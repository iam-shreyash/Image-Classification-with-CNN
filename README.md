# 🏠 CIFAR-10 Image Classification with ANN and CNN

## 📌 Objective
This project demonstrates how to classify images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset** using two different neural network architectures: an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The code is written in Python using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.
